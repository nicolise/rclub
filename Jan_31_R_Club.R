#Chapter 3
# Read chapter 3. It is a little abstract but I think it is worth starting to become familiar with these terms. ï¿½
#Execute the chapter 3 code.
#Answer the following questions, using 1 - 2 sentences each:

#3.1 Define aesthetics as they are used in ggplot2.
#The size, shape, color, etc. attributes of geoms represented on an (x, y) grid.

#3.2 What does it mean to "map" an aesthetic?
#To create new column variable(s) that refer to the (x ,y) point(s). For example, this can be #used to separate rows by 2 categorical variables represented in different colors.

#3.3 Explain scales as they relate to data and aesthetics.
#Scales connect the data points (x,y) and the computer graphical representation.
#Example: Liter values 1:10 could be scaled from 1 (light grey) to 10 (black). 

#3.4 What are geoms?
#Goems are geometric objects that are displayed in ggplot.
#Examples: points, lines, bars.

#Code
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, colour = factor(cyl))
qplot(displ, hwy, data=mpg, facets = . ~ year) + geom_smooth()
